# CTF.2021

A Mini Capture-the-Flag on Linux, SSH, and Git

In this challenge, you must find a command that gives the response to the
exercise questions below. All exercises have been designed so that a single
command from your local machine can give the correct response. You will need to
connect to the remote server to access the files in it and can use the
interactive terminal to explore, but try to write your responses as a single
command.

You should submit your solutions by making a pull request of this repository,
adding a file "solutions/$number.sh". The solution must show first the result
and the command used to obtain this result as comments and must be executable
bash scripts which give the response.

 If a solution has already been accepted, you can propose a different command to
get the same solution by creating a pull request which modifies the existing
solution file by adding a new command line.

Points will be awarded for the first solution and for alternative commands
given afterwards. The points ranking will be announced on Slack by Monday, or
sooner if all exercises are completed.

Good luck!
